## About The Project
Miranum Platform is an open source production ready process automation platform with a focus on human-task driven processes.
Many components of this repository are based on the [DigiWF project](https://github.com/it-at-m/digiwf-core).

## Use-Cases

## Platform Overview
Miranum Platform uses Camunda 7 as process engine with Polyflow for task handling. 
In addition, system components such as Keycloak, Nginx, PostgreSQL and Minio are being used.
The latter tools are interchangeable but work best in the current version.
![Platform Overview](./docs/imgs/miranum-platform.png)

Components: 
* Engine Tasklist Service: Includes [Camunda Platform 7](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-bpm-platform), [Polyflow](https://github.com/holunda-io/camunda-bpm-taskpool) and the Miranum Tasklist Backend.
* Miranum Tasklist Webapp: Single-page application build with vue.js which renders the forms and tasklist. 
* Miranum IDE: Collection of [vs-code plugins](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=miragon-gmbh.miranum-ide) to model bpmn processes, dmn decisions and forms using [vuetify-jsonschema-forms](https://github.com/koumoul-dev/vuetify-jsonschema-form).
* Schema Registry Service:
* Deployment Service:
* Keycloak:Open Source Identity and Access Management tool
* Nginx: Ingress controller
* PostgreSQL: Relational database
* Minio: MinIO is a High Performance Object Storage which is API compatible with Amazon S3 cloud storage service.
